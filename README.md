# Leam-US

This repository contains the model code. We took the effort to run the model and running the model and its subsequent instructions can be found in the following repo: https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Interactive-Neural-Process?tab=readme-ov-file. Follow the instructions related to LEAM-US, specifically the dataset download. After that is done, please run the model.ipynb notebook to see our model's prediction outputs. Run the vis.ipynb file to see debugging of the model run. Same with events.ipynb.
